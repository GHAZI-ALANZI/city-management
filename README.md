## 🌆 ********City Management Microservices System**********
Transforming Smart City Management with Modern Technology

## 🚀 Introduction
The City Management Microservices System is a scalable and modular platform designed to enhance urban governance through automation, big data analytics, and AI-driven predictions. This project follows a microservices architecture to provide flexible, independent, and scalable services for city management.

## 🚧 ⚠️ The project is in its early stages, and active development is ongoing to expand its capabilities. 🚧


## ***🌍 Future vision: The system is designed to scale beyond a single city and can be expanded to support multiple cities or even a small country in the future.

## 🎯 Why This Project?
✅ Efficient City Management – Streamlining key city services like transportation, healthcare, real estate, and public infrastructure.
✅ Proactive Decision-Making – Utilizing AI and predictive analytics to anticipate and mitigate problems in economy, healthcare, and urban development before they occur.
✅ Process Automation – Reducing bureaucracy, optimizing workflows, and accelerating emergency response.
✅ Scalability & Expansion – Designed for multi-city or nationwide deployment in the future.
✅ Modular & Extensible Architecture – Easily add new services and features as the system grows.

The system collects, processes, and analyzes real-time city data, enabling authorities to make informed, data-driven decisions that improve urban efficiency, sustainability, and citizen well-being.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
This project is built with modern and cutting-edge technologies to ensure high performance, security, and scalability.

📌 Backend (Microservices Architecture)
-C# (.NET 8+) – High-performance microservices for each city function.
-PHP 8 (Laravel).
-Domain-Driven Design (DDD) – Ensuring modularity and maintainability.
-Event-Driven Architecture (Kafka) – Enabling real-time data processing and high availability.
-REST APIs – Providing flexible, efficient data communication.
-Entity Framework Core ,SQL SERVER , Redis and MySql – A robust and scalable database solution.

## 🎨 Frontend Applications
-Angular 19 – Admin Dashboard for city officials and service management.
-Next.js (React) – Citizen Portal for public interaction and service requests.
-MAUI & WPF – Cross-platform mobile and desktop applications for city services.

## ☁️ Infrastructure & DevOps
-Docker & Kubernetes – Ensuring smooth deployment and horizontal scalability.
-GitHub Actions (CI/CD) – Automating building, testing, and deployment.
-Identity Server (OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect) – Secure authentication and authorization.
-Serilog & Elastic Stack – Advanced logging and real-time monitoring.

## 📌 System Architecture
The project follows a microservices-based distributed architecture, where each service is responsible for a specific domain within the city.

## 🔐 Authentication Flow for Admin Dashboard (Angular)
User logsin to city dashboard via the NEXT JS (login-city-mangement-dashboard-with-auth-web-frontend), sending credentials to the ASP.NET Core API(user_city_management_service).
The API validates the credentials and returns a JWT token that contains the user’s role.
The Next.js app stores the token in cookies.
On accessing the Admin Dashboard, the Next.js app decodes the token to check if the user has the "fulladmin" role.

If the user is authorized, they can access the dashboard(city-mangement-dashboard-with-auth-web-frontend); otherwise, they are redirected.


## 🔮 Predictive Analytics & Smart City Insights

📊 Economic Forecasting – Detect potential financial crises or market instabilities.
🏥 Healthcare Risk Monitoring – Identify public health risks before outbreaks occur.
🚧 Infrastructure Analysis – Prevent failures by predicting wear and tear on roads, utilities, and public services.
🚦 Traffic & Transportation Optimization – Enhance public transport efficiency and reduce congestion.

By integrating machine learning and real-time analytics, the platform empowers cities to proactively solve problems instead of merely reacting to them.

## 📈 Future Roadmap

🚀 Multi-City & Nationwide Expansion – Extending the system to manage multiple cities or a small country.
🧠 Enhanced AI Integration – Improving data-driven forecasting and city simulations.
🔗 Blockchain for Secure Transactions – Implementing tamper-proof financial and property records.
📡 IoT & 5G Integration – Enabling smart city device connectivity for real-time urban monitoring.

## 📢 Conclusion
This project is a stepping stone toward the future of smart city management. By combining automation, predictive analytics, and AI-powered decision-making, it transforms urban governance into a data-driven, proactive, and citizen-centric system.

## 🚀 A smarter city, a better future! 🌍
